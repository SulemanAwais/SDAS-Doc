This page is an overview of the Sensor Data Acquisition System.

**SDAS** is a platform for acquiring data from the sensors of smart devices. A subject carries that smart device, and performs a motion activity. As the subject moves, the values of motion sensors are changed respectively. All those values are then recorded with their timestamps.
Once an activity is successfully performed, the system stops redording data and the recorded data is then stored along with the activity details.
