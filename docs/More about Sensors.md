# Learn more about sensors
A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The input can be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure, or any number of other environmental phenomena. The output is generally a signal that is converted to a human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing.
Sensors play a pivotal role in the Internet of things (IoT). They make it possible to create an ecosystem for collecting and processing data about a specific environment so it can be monitored, managed, and controlled more easily and efficiently. IoT sensors are used in homes, out in the field, in automobiles, on airplanes, in industrial settings, and in other environments. Sensors bridge the gap between the physical world and the logical world, acting as the eyes and ears for a computing infrastructure that analyzes and acts upon the data collected from the sensors([Robert Sheldon](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/sensor)). 

Sensors are an integral part of modern living. If you are reading this article on a computer, you are most likely using a mouse, which contains an optical sensor. If you are on a smartphone, you are using touch sensors every time you touch the screen.
In Sensor Data Acquisition System, we have covered five sensors
 - **Accelerometer** 
 - **Gyroscope** 
 - **Magnetometer**
 - **Linear Accelerometer**
 - **Gravity**
## Accelerometer

An accelerometer is an electromechanical device that is used to measure acceleration forces. Such forces may be static like the force of gravity or, they may be dynamic as in the case of mobile devices([BYJU'S](https://byjus.com/physics/accelerometer/)).
<!-- 
#### Accelerometer in smart devices
The accelerometer in a smartphone measures the linear acceleration of the device. When at rest position in whatever orientation, the figure represents the force of gravity acting on the device at the same time it also measures the acceleration on the X and Y axis which will be zero.
It detects changes in the orientation and accordingly rotates the mobile screen. Basically, it helps your smartphone know up form down. -->


## Gyroscope

is a device used for measuring or maintaining orientation and angular velocity.[1][2] It is a spinning wheel or disc in which the axis of rotation (spin axis) is free to assume any orientation by itself. When rotating, the orientation of this axis is unaffected by tilting or rotation of the mounting, according to the conservation of angular momentum([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope)).

<!-- #### Gyroscope in smart devices

Gyroscope Sensors have become an indispensable part of smartdevices these days. All the games which we play using motion senses are because of the gyroscope sensor. One of the best examples is the very popular Pokemon Go game which is completely based on the principle of gyroscopic sensors. We also need a gyroscope to view 360-degree videos on our mobile phones. -->

## Magnetometer

A magnetometer is a device that measures the magnetic field or magnetic dipole moment. Different types of magnetometers measure the direction, strength, or relative change of a magnetic field at a particular location. A compass is one such device, one that measures the direction of an ambient magnetic field, in this case, the Earth's magnetic field. Other magnetometers measure the magnetic dipole moment of a magnetic material such as a ferromagnet, for example by recording the effect of this magnetic dipole on the induced current in a coil([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer)).

<!-- #### Magnetometer in smart devices

The magnetometer sensor in a device detects the magnetic orientation of the device in relation to the X, Y, and Z axes in relation to the real-world north direction beside the electromagnetic field EMF. -->
## Linear Accelerometer
The linear accelerometer measures the acceleration applied to the sensor built-in into the device, excluding the force of gravity, in m/s². For example, you could use this sensor to see how fast your car is going. The linear acceleration sensor always has an offset, which you need to remove. The simplest way to do this is to build a calibration step into your application([AWARE](https://awareframework.com/linear-accelerometer/)).

## Gravity
Gravity sensors are precise devices that detect minute localized changes in the force of Earth’s gravity caused by variations in rock or other materials’ density underground([Ben Pilkington](https://www.azosensors.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2482#:~:text=Gravity%20sensors%20are%20precise%20devices,greater%20detail%20than%20ever%20before.)).
