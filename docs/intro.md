**Human Activity Recognition** continues to present a formidable challenge, however, it is imperative to find a solution due to its potential applications in eldercare and healthcare. When combined with technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), it has the potential to serve as an effective assistive technology. This recognition can be achieved through the use of sensors or through cameras.
If we talk about camera,there are several limitations of monitoring human activity using them such as: 
- Privacy Concerns: The use of cameras for monitoring raises serious privacy concerns, as people may not want to be monitored constantly.

- Technical Limitations: Camera-based activity recognition can be limited by lighting conditions, camera placement, and other technical factors that can affect the quality of the video footage.

- False Recognitions: The accuracy of camera-based activity recognition can be affected by factors such as body posture, clothing, and background clutter, leading to false recognitions.

- Cost: Camera-based activity recognition systems can be expensive to set up and maintain, requiring specialized hardware and software.

- Limited Scope: Camera-based activity recognition systems are typically limited to indoor environments and may not be suitable for outdoor or large-scale applications.

Keeping all the above listed points in mind, a sensor-based activity monitoring system would be a better option because of its benefits like:

- Privacy: Sensors do not capture images or videos, **reducing privacy concerns** and making them more acceptable to people who are being monitored.

- Increased Accuracy: Sensors can provide more accurate data compared to cameras as they can measure physical parameters such as movement, pressure, and acceleration more effectively.

- Lower Cost: Sensors are typically less expensive than cameras and can be used in a wider range of applications. They can also be more scalable, allowing for large-scale monitoring systems to be set up more easily and cost-effectively.

- Flexibility: Sensors can be integrated into various wearable devices, such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and clothing, making it possible to monitor activity in real-time.

- Versatility: Sensors can be used for activity recognition in both indoor and outdoor environments and can be integrated into various applications such as healthcare, eldercare, sports, and more.

In conclusion, while both camera-based and sensor-based activity monitoring systems have their strengths and weaknesses, **sensor-based systems** offer several benefits that make them an attractive option for many applications.
