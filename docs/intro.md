# What are sensors?

Sensors are an integral part of modern living. If you are reading this article on a computer, you are most likely using a mouse, which contains an optical sensor. If you are on a smartphone, you are using touch sensors every time you touch the screen.
In Sensor Data Acquisition System, we have coverred five sensors
 - **Accelerometer** 
 - **Gyroscope** 
 - **Magnetometer**
 - **Linear Acceleration**
 - **Gravity**
## Accelerometer

The accelerometer is an electromechanical device that measures the force of acceleration caused by movement or by gravity or by vibration. These forces can be static like gravity force, dynamic senses movement, or vibrations.
<!-- 
#### Accelerometer in smart devices
The accelerometer in smartphone measures the linear acceleration of the device. When at rest position in whatever orientation, the figure represents the force of gravity active on the device at the same time it also measures the acceleration on the X and Y axis which will be zero.
It detects changes in the orientation and accordingly rotates the mobile screen. Basically, it helps your smartphone know up form down. -->


## Gyroscope

A gyroscope sensor is basically a device that takes the help of the earth’s gravity in determining the orientation. It is is generally used to measure the orientation of bodies. It can be used to measure the angular motion in moving bodies.A gyroscope is considered to be an extremely important device because of its ability to measure orientation. 

<!-- #### Gyroscope in smart devices

Gyroscope Sensors have become an indispensable part of smartdevices these days. All the games which we play using motion senses are because of the gyroscope sensor. One of the best examples is the very popular Pokemon Go game which is completely based on the principle of gyroscopic sensors. We also need a gyroscope to view 360-degree videos on our mobile phones. -->

## Magnetometer

A magnetometer or compass is a navigation instrument that can identify a specific reference direction (usually the north) in the horizontal plane, allowing horizontal angles to be measured with respect to this direction. Magnetometers can work in several ways. The simplest, the magnetic compass, also simply known as a magnetometer, tracks the orientation of a magnetic needle within the Earth’s magnetic field, in the same way as a traditional compass.

<!-- #### Magnetometer in smart devices

The magnetometer sensor in a device detects the magnetic orientation of the device in relation to the X, Y and Z axes in relation to the real world north direction beside electromagnetic field EMF. -->

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
