# Smartwatch Application 
The smartwatch application is developed in [Android](https://developer.android.com/). The code is developed for [Wear OS](https://wearos.google.com/), which is an operating system designed for smartwatches and other wearable devices.

## Working :
- **Sensor Initialization:**  The code initializes the sensor manager and creates a list to store sensor objects. It obtains references to sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, linear accelerometer, and gravity.

- **Sensor Registration:** The code registers sensor listeners for each sensor in the list, specifying the sensor event listener (implemented by the activity itself) and the desired sensor delay.

- **UI Initialization:** The code initializes TextView objects to display sensor data. It retrieves references to the TextViews using their respective IDs defined in the layout XML file.

- **`onSensorChanged():`** This method is called when a sensor value changes. It checks the sensor type and updates the corresponding TextViews with the new sensor values.

- **`onAccuracyChanged():`** This method is not utilized in the given code.

- **`Activity Lifecycle:`** The code overrides the `onCreate()` method, where it sets the content view for the activity and performs initialization tasks such as retrieving sensor references and initializing UI elements.

In summary, the code sets up a Wear OS application that collects sensor data from various sensors, registers sensor listeners, and updates the UI to display the sensor values in real-time.

## Submodules:
### Libraries Used:

- `android.app.Activity:` It provides the base class for activities in Android, representing a single screen with a user interface.
- `android.hardware.Sensor:` It represents a sensor on an Android device, such as an accelerometer or gyroscope.
- `android.hardware.SensorEvent:` It represents a sensor event containing sensor data, such as sensor values and timestamp.
- `android.hardware.SensorEventListener:` It is an interface that defines methods to handle sensor events, such as onSensorChanged() and onAccuracyChanged().
- `android.hardware.SensorManager:` It is a system service that provides access to the device's sensors and sensor-related operations.
- `android.os.Bundle:` It is used to pass data between Android components, such as activities.
- `android.widget.TextView:` It is a user interface element that displays text on the screen.
- `com.example.sdas_wear_app.databinding.ActivityMainBinding:` It is a data-binding class generated by the Android Data Binding Library, used for accessing views in the layout XML file.
### Code Explanation:

- The code defines a class `named MainActivity` that extends `android.app.Activity` and implements `android.hardware.SensorEventListener`.
-  In the `onCreate()` method, the code sets the content view for the activity using data binding. It initializes the sensor manager, creates an empty list to store sensor objects, and retrieves references to sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, linear accelerometer, and gravity using the sensor manager.
- The code registers sensor listeners for each sensor in the list using the sensor manager. It also initializes TextView objects to display sensor data by retrieving references to TextViews from the layout XML file.
- The `onSensorChanged()` method is called when a sensor value changes. It checks the sensor type using `sensorEvent.sensor.getType()` and updates the corresponding TextViews with the new sensor values using `setText()`.
- The `onAccuracyChanged()` method is not utilized in the given code.
- The code overrides the activity lifecycle methods, such as `onCreate()`, but doesn't provide any additional implementation for them.
