# What are sensors?

Sensors are an integral part of modern living. If you are reading this article on a computer, you are most likely using a mouse, which contains an optical sensor. If you are on a smartphone, you are using touch sensors every time you touch the screen.
In Sensor Data Acquisition System, we have coverred five sensors
 - **Accelerometer** 
 - **Gyroscope** 
 - **Magnetometer**
 - **Linear Acceleration**
 - **Gravity**
## Accelerometer

The accelerometer is an electromechanical device that measures the force of acceleration caused by movement or by gravity or by vibration. These forces can be static like gravity force, dynamic senses movement, or vibrations.
<!-- 
#### Accelerometer in smart devices
The accelerometer in smartphone measures the linear acceleration of the device. When at rest position in whatever orientation, the figure represents the force of gravity active on the device at the same time it also measures the acceleration on the X and Y axis which will be zero.
It detects changes in the orientation and accordingly rotates the mobile screen. Basically, it helps your smartphone know up form down. -->


## Gyroscope

A gyroscope sensor is basically a device that takes the help of the earth’s gravity in determining the orientation. It is is generally used to measure the orientation of bodies. It can be used to measure the angular motion in moving bodies.A gyroscope is considered to be an extremely important device because of its ability to measure orientation. 

<!-- #### Gyroscope in smart devices

Gyroscope Sensors have become an indispensable part of smartdevices these days. All the games which we play using motion senses are because of the gyroscope sensor. One of the best examples is the very popular Pokemon Go game which is completely based on the principle of gyroscopic sensors. We also need a gyroscope to view 360-degree videos on our mobile phones. -->

## Magnetometer

A magnetometer or compass is a navigation instrument that can identify a specific reference direction (usually the north) in the horizontal plane, allowing horizontal angles to be measured with respect to this direction. Magnetometers can work in several ways. The simplest, the magnetic compass, also simply known as a magnetometer, tracks the orientation of a magnetic needle within the Earth’s magnetic field, in the same way as a traditional compass.

<!-- #### Magnetometer in smart devices

The magnetometer sensor in a device detects the magnetic orientation of the device in relation to the X, Y and Z axes in relation to the real world north direction beside electromagnetic field EMF. -->
